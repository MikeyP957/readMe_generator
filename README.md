  ## Installation:  
  This application runs in the command line. A user can open the command line (either terminal or git bash), and type in 'node index.js'. For this to run properly the user must check to confirm that this command is running in the same directory that this code is written.

  ## Usage Instructions:
  This application can be used in terminal or git bash. Once the application is running the user will be asked a series of questions regarding the project. When all questions are answered the program will generate a Readme.md file that will include the user's responses. Each response will be included in the corresponding section in the readme. If the user does not choose a license the Readme will not be affected, i.e. there will be no license section.
